# tigris-http
🐍 Python FastAPI wrapper for the Tigris HTTP API Quickstart as found on 
https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-http/


## dev-note
This project is just for concept comprehension of the API calls. In a production environment you would want to change
all the "get" methods to "post" to keep data hidden. Perhaps at some point I will craft a decent front-end for it 😅
